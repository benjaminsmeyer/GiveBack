# GiveBack

GiveBack is an app designed to help people donate their unused or excess items to local charities and non-profits. The app aims to reduce waste and promote sustainability by providing a convenient and efficient way for individuals to give back to their community.

Features:

- Browse large and local charities for ones that fit your values
- Donate to charities conveniently
- Track the amounts you've donated to charities
- Observe the largest charity donors
- Match with a charity that best aligns with your beliefs

## Inspiration
At our core, we believe that everyone has the power to make a positive impact on the world and that being charitable is one of the most potent ways to do so. Through this belief, we were inspired to create a website that allows users to find nonprofit organizations that align with their values and make it simple to donate to these organizations. Through this, our team hopes to inspire a culture of giving and empower individuals to make a difference in their own way.


## What it does
GiveBack is a website that helps users find nonprofit organizations that align with their values and makes it easy to donate to these organizations. The website provides a simple, easy-to-use interface for users to find organizations that resonate with them and make a difference in the areas they care about most. 

Users can choose an amount they wish to donate and help spread hope with the click of a button. The app also allows users to track their donation history and encourages them to participate in more humane acts with a leaderboard showing the top donors.


## How we built it
We built the GiveBack website using a combination of technologies, including React for the website application, Python, and Fast API for an efficient backend. 


## Challenges we ran into
As half of our team had little to no web development experience, we spent the hackathon's initial hours researching and learning as much as we could about React.js and web development. We faced numerous challenges along the way, from setting up our development environment to understanding the intricacies of React.js components and state management. 

Despite the challenges, we persevered and worked tirelessly through the night, fueled by the excitement of building something from scratch. Finally, after hours of coding and debugging, we had a working prototype of our React.js, the GiveBack website.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of creating an app that makes it easy for users to find and donate to local charities and non-profits. We're also proud of the clean and logical website design which is simple and easy to use. Two of us are also happy to have created any semblance of a website in the first place as being first years we came to this hackathon with little to no experience with coding a website.


## What we learned
Before the hackathon, some of us had only dabbled in web development and had no experience with React.js or Python. However, through our shared dedication and determination, our team was able to learn and build something truly remarkable. 

On the programming side, we learned how to set up a development environment, how to use React.js to create user interfaces and components, and how to use Python to build the back-end logic of our application. We also learned about different libraries and frameworks, such as Chakra UI, which helped us create a polished and efficient final product.

On the nonprofit side, we learned a lot about the nonprofit sector and the different types of organizations that exist. We also learned about the various challenges that charities and non-profits face, and how our app can help address some of these challenges. 

Most importantly, we learned the power of teamwork and collaboration. We came into the hackathon as strangers but left as friends and partners, united in our goal to create something meaningful and a shared taste for boba tea.


## What's next for GiveBack
Moving forward, we plan to continue to grow our network of local charities and non-profits to make it easier for users to find organizations that align with any user's values. We also plan to expand our app to new regions and communities. Additionally, we want to build more features into the app and expand on what a user could donate and make a positive impact in their communities.
